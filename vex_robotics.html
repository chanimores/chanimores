									<p>For four years, I was part of a two-person competitive robotics team as the programmer and driver.
										We competed in dozens of local events and qualified for the VEX World Championships three years in a row,
										even winning the <i>Think Award</i> for our impressive and effective programming, something I
										am still super proud about, as we are one of the few local teams to have come home with an award from worlds!
										In 2019, we came in sixth in our division!
							</p>

							<p>The competitions themselves were composed of many matches that each team had to do. The team would be paired up with another,
							and the two of you would compete against two others in a timed match, where the goal of the game was to score as many points as possible.
							The way to score differed from year to year, something involving throwing a ball to a target or stacking blocks and putting them somewhere.
							Regardless, the aim of the game was to design, create, and program a robot that was as efficient as possible.</p>

									<h2>My Role as the Programmer of Team 5106C</h2>
									<p>As the programmer, my job was split into two roles: programming the <i>autonomous</i> portion of match, and programming the <i>controls</i> for the driver.
									Our main tagline as a team was making the robot <i>smart</i> in a variety of ways, using sensors and smart programming to create an efficient competition bot.
									The programming itself was initially done in <b>C</b>, then moved to <b>C++</b> when the new VEX V5 hardware came out.
									</p>

									<p>What is the autonomous portion? At the start of every match, there would be a 15-second period where the robot had to act completely autonomously
										and try to score points (or perform other actions) without any driver input. The team scoring the most points in this period is also awarded bonus points for "winning the autonomous."
										Because of this, it is a crucial period of the game, as an efficient autonomous can make or break many match outcomes.
										As the programmer, one of my roles was to design, implement, and test our robot's autonomous programs, with different programs
										based on the actions we want to perform or the starting location of the robot.
										A huge part of this was trying to use many sensors, such as sonars, buttons, potentiometers, even cameras, to ensure that the robot was in the right location.
										For instance, we used the sonar frequently to check how far we are from the wall, or using the camera (which detects color and shape) to determine if we are
										close enough to a target to score properly.
									</p>

									<p>The other major of programming for such a robot is programming the controls. On a basic level, this would be mapping the robot movement (driving) to
									buttons or joysticks, but we wanted to be more efficient. Many of the tasks done in a match by a driver were repetitive, whether dropping a stack of blocks
									very carefully or shooting a ball at a very specific speed. These could very easily be automated, so one of our huge goals was to make the robot as easy
									as possible to drive, so that I, as the driver, could focus on scoring and strategy as opposed to being super focused on getting all the machinery to work
									together. To do this, we implemented a bunch of "tasks" which varied. For instance, in the third year, we created a button I could hold down which would
										prepare the ball shooter to spin to the correct speed and immediately shoot the ball as soon as the camera detected we were at the correct range.
									All in all, all these automated buttons and tasks meant that by the end of the competition season, our robot was extremely efficient at scoring and
									fantastic to drive. </p>
