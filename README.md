Thanks for visiting my profile! :sparkles: 

I'm an undergraduate student at McGill University studying Computer Science and Physics. I'm interested in all things related to science, programming, and game development! In my free time, I like to do digital art (both 2D and 3D!), play video games, and do programming side-projects for fun.
